One has a perfect night planned. Weeks waiting for the opportunity to go to that restaurant everybody is talking about and the moment has finally arrived. In your head, a delicious meal with an exquisite wine and in excellent company. A tasty dessert and a good sleep. You have the picture right there, in your mind, imagining every detail as you get ready to leave, but at the precise minute you're getting inside the car your cell phone starts ringing. No problem, you think, it must be her, just checking out. And when you pick up your phone and hear the voice speaking to you, everything starts falling apart. A server has broken down! That can't be happening to me, not now, it isn't fair, you think. But reality hits you and the next thing you do after hanging up is calling her to apologize. Surely she will find someone else to have dinner with...

Regarding you, you spend your entire night awake, trying to fix things up. And although deep inside you you're a little bit disappointed with how things turned out, what you really feels is adrenaline running through your veins, an extremely delightful excitment which you enjoy despite any circumstances around. Good thing, you have mate and loud music to get you focused. But to remember: next time, save some beers for these moments.
