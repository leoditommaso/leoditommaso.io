summary: One could open a debate among IT professionals and discuss for hours regarding
  technical aspects of different operating systems. Stability, security,
  usability, UI, CPU scheduling, memory and I/O management, networking performance,
  package managers... the list would be endless, as would be the arguments that
  supports one operating system or the other.

One could open a debate among IT professionals and discuss for hours regarding
technical aspects of different operating systems. Stability, security,
usability, UI, CPU scheduling, memory and I/O management, networking performance,
package managers... the list would be endless, as would be the arguments that
supports one operating system or the other.

I've used a lot of different OSs. In fact, not so many years ago, my notebook
(the one I used for work and for my 'experiments') was reinstalled once a week.
Mandrake, Debian, Red Hat, Fedora, Slackware, Gentoo, Suse, Knoppix, Xandros,
Linspire, Ubuntu, CentOS (just to name some Linux distros) and of course every 
BSD flavour: FreeBSD, NetBSD, PC-BSD, even OpenBSD on a MacBook Pro (getting 
everything to work was truly a challenge!). Nowadays I'm stabilized (you bet!). 
I use Linux, Mac and Windows on a daily basis; Linux on 99% of the servers
I've access to, Mac on my personal computer and Windows... well, unfortunately
I can't always avoid it.

But although I'm really happy with Mac as my desktop and I love Linux, I've
never felt anything comparable to what FreeBSD makes me feel. It's like the
childhood sweet girl one was deeply in love and still remembers her with
affection and nostalgia. Nowadays it's not possible to get back to those lovely
moments and see that girl again, but what it's in fact possible is to get back
to the agreeable little devil... and so I did!
