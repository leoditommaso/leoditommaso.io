Here I am, sitting in front of my computer, starting another blog... But this
time is different for many reasons, as detailed below.

* This is not Wordpress, which was (and still is for many sites) my blogging
  platform of choice. Instead, I'm currently using Jekyll which I'm starting to
  love.
* I am not writing this with a slow web-based WYSIWYG or HTML editor, but with
  the command-line best editor ever (vim) and in a plain text file.
* No more plugins, extensive css, js or PHP files to follow, understand and edit
  to have a site that looks and behaves the way I want. Instead, simple Ruby
  code and some sass are going to be my allies from now on.
* And... no Spanish this time. That will be the second of my two challenges. The
  first one will be to write some interesting stuff (not like this one I hope).

If you'd like to see any of the stuff I've written before you'd better go to a
psychologist. If you've talked about this with your psychologist and for some
reason are still interested then you could visit [Mikroways website][mikroways]
which is my IT company or you could also visit my [personal pictures website][leandroditommaso]
(apart from nerdish stuff I also love travelling and taking pictures).

And finally, you can always follow me on any of the five thousands social
networks profiles I have. Some of them are:

* [Facebook][facebook]
* [Github][github]
* [Twitter][twitter]
