I do think that knowledge should be free for everyone so you could try, use, extend,
correct, share, etc anything you find here. The only thing I will ask you is to 
make a reference to this blog. In the same way, if you'd like to contribute to 
this site it would be great to include your own stuff here and a reference to
you'll be attached to it.

### But what about licesing then?

I don't know much about licensing and I don't really care about it. So this
site's license is a compromise between you and me in which both of us respect
everything I've written in the paragraph above.

### Responsibility

As I said you could use anything included here the way you want, but do it at
your own responsibility. That means that if something you read here breaks your
computer, your network or your work's farm of servers it's you the one to be
blamed for.
