Esto debería estar en español.

This is my personal space to share my thoughts and experiencies about IT related
stuff such as networking, servers and services, applications and development.
Not everything here will be 100% accurate as many times I will post about stuff 
I'm just trying or learning, so don't take everything as a word of tongue.

Although I'm Spanish native speaking I will write this blog in English as a
personal challenge and as another way of learning and sharing, so if you see
something I wrote sucks feel free to tell me (not limited just to my English
knowledge).

### About me

I've started my IT degree at [UNLP][UNLP] in 2005 at the age of 18 and I've been
working as a Sysadmin since 2007. I loved servers and networks from the very
beggining and it always was my area of interest, what limited my coding needs to
plain bash scripts... and I was happy with that!

But the wind have changed. Nowadays we, Sysadmins, are turning into a new role
which happens to be called DevOps, in which my powerful bash scripts are not
enough and coding skills become more important.

I'm actually working as a DevOp at UNLP and I have my own company called
[Mikroways][Mikroways], through which you could hire me.

For any additional details about me professionally speaking, you could check out
[my LinkedIn profile][LinkedIn] or [my CV][CV] (which are only available in
Spanish for now...).

### Now what?

Just get lost in the posts of this blog. If you're lucky enough you may found
something interesting around there.
