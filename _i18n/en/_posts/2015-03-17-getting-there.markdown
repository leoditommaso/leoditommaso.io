title:  "Getting there!"

summary: I'm writing this post on the plane which is taking me, my parents and my
  youngest sister from Buenos Aires to Paris. We've been on the plane for about
  five hours now and we have another eight hours left, but we're getting closer to
  Paris, we're getting there! And that fact made me reflect on the objectives I
  have in my life and whether I'm getting closer to meet them or not.

I'm writing this post on the plane which is taking me, my parents and my
youngest sister from Buenos Aires to Paris. We've been on the plane for about
five hours now and we have another eight hours left, but we're getting closer to
Paris, we're getting there! And that fact made me reflect on the objectives I
have in my life and whether I'm getting closer to meet them or not.

Very often I feel overwhelmed looking forward because there's too much I want to
do, too much I wish to accomplish, too many objectives I'd like to fulfill. That 
partial vision makes it difficult to appreciate everything I've done. But when
I'm able to change my pace of life I usually look back, just to realize how much
I've achieved, how many of my goals I've completed and how, some of those long
term objectives are closer to be reached than were a year ago. And suddenly I
start feeling much better.

In conclusion, I think it's extremely important to give oneself the chance to
have a retrospective look at one's life, not to live on the past but to
value the effort made and be aware of its results. That way is easier to be
enthusiast about the future and gain the necessary energies to move forward.
There isn't a formula to be able to stop and look back; I think, instead, that
each one must find it's own way. For me, for example, it's travelling. And
so, here I am.
