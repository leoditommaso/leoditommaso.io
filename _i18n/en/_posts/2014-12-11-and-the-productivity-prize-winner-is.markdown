I'm a productive eager person. I may start today doing a list of how many articles,
applications, techniques and a long list of etceteras I've tried and it'll
probably take some years to finish (based on that, I could also say I'm a little bit
exaggerated, don't you think?). But really, I spend a lot of time and effort trying to be
more and more productive every day. And although I'm much more organized now than
I was some time before I'm always failing on being as productive as I'd like
(it seems that one does never get good enough...). There are many many days I know
I did nothing productive and that feels awful, like if I was in a terrible pain.
I even get depressed sometimes. But I know I'm not the only one that feels that way.

I think that we're gears in a huge economic system which demands tons
of work and which is never satisfied, no matter how hard we try or how much we do.
And we were educated to be functional to that system and that's why we end up
punishing ourselves those 'productivityless' days.

Today I've read another article about productivity but this one has a different
focus, a focus that made me think and motivated me to write this post.
Because of that, I want to share the article with you. Start enjoying it right now,
as it's inspiring from it's very title: [10 Inspirational Quotes to Make You Feel
Better About Not Getting Anything Done Today][article].

This post's intention is to activate the chip on my mind that should warn me
when I'm taking myself too far, the same chip that should remind me that I'm not
alive just to win the productivity prize but to live and enjoy my life. And so
do you. I hope the same chip will be activated on you and when that happens you
could join me, I will be drinking some beers with friends, wasting our time,
living our lives.
